# Overview
This project provides a basic implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Keras and TensorFlow. ANNs are powerful models inspired by the human brain and can be used for solving a variety of tasks such as:

Classification: Categorizing inputs into distinct classes (e.g., image classification, spam detection).
Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., house price prediction, stock price forecasting).
The goal is to understand how ANNs work, from designing the network architecture to training and evaluating the model.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (for deep learning framework)
Keras (as high-level API)
NumPy, Pandas (for data handling and manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
# Model Architecture
The ANN model used in this project consists of the following layers:

Input Layer: Takes the input features from the dataset (e.g., pixel values for image data or numerical data for tabular datasets).
Hidden Layers: Includes one or more fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU activation functions.
Output Layer: Uses an appropriate activation function (softmax for classification, linear for regression).# artificial-neural-network
# Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ann-project.git
Install the required libraries:

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib
Prepare the dataset:

Load your dataset (e.g., CSV file) into the project. Ensure that the input features and target variables are correctly formatted.

# Usage
Here’s how to use the ANN model:

Load and preprocess the data:

Use Pandas and NumPy to load and preprocess the data. Split the data into training and test sets:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Build and compile the model:

Define the ANN architecture and compile it:

model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=X_train.shape[1]),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # For binary classification
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
Train the model:

Train the model using the training data:

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
Evaluate the model:

After training, evaluate the model on the test set:

loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy}')
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
# Key Features
Customizable ANN Architecture: Easily modify the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions.
Training and Validation: Monitor the model’s performance using training and validation sets.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate accuracy, loss, and make predictions on new data.
Data Visualization: Visualize learning curves, performance metrics, and dataset distributions.
